Pitch: budget enclosed belted 3D printer. Can print farm for all my YSWS needs. Also just a fun device

Links I've gathered so far:

I want to do something like this? and then a fusion of The 100

I want this thing to be very easy to mod & hack. Should be able to live on my desk if I want

MUST be enclosed. I'll print the parts out of ABS

Testing the automatic fetching
