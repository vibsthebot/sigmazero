# firstly,

This 3D printer has been made possible by Hack Club and the awesome Alex Ren. Let's give them a hand! 👏👏👏

# about

I'm Anicetus, and I'm making a CoreXY because my Anycubic Kobra 2 Neo doesn't print over 250mm/s and can't print hotter than PETG. This will change all of that.

🕐Speed I want: >350mm/s (probably can get faster)  
📐Build size I want: >300mm<sup>3</sup> (maybe not, may have to go 250mm<sup>3</sup>)  
👍Materials I want to print with: TPU, PLA, PETG, HIPS (maybe,) PVA (probably not)  


OK, good. Down to business.

# day 1
Today I'm researching some parts!! Good stuff. I think ima use the Rapido ACE hotend and BTT SKR E3 mainboard. Other than that, I have no idea.

The Rapido ACE HF is built for ~45mm<sup>3</sup>/s printing, which is really really fast and happy. I may upgrade to the UHF if I'm underbudget and want to go 75mm<sup>3</sup>/s.

I'm going with Nema 17 stepper motors, the most popular for CoreXY.

So far, we're at 125 USD. 😬


Next, I looked for extruders. I went with the Orbiter v1.5, since it's smaller and has a lot of support. For PSU, I went a generic 24v 600W.

I started CAD-ing, and got only the hotend and extruder in their places :P

Research and parts: 3 hrs
CAD: 30 minutes
