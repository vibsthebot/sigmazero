# Concept - Feb 1st, 2025
Production-ready 3d printer based on a Ender 5 frame, with multifunction tool changing.

The basic concept is this: A desktop machine with plug and play heads and beds. Chain these together and add robot carriages in between and you got yourself an awesome factory that can fit in a bench. This is an opensource project. The cost of the _entire system_ will likely be several thousand dollars, with the main machine limited to $300 budget. I aim to lower the cost of a complete industrial system as much as possible.

The head and bed have 2 communication lanes and 2 high power lanes. It is assumed that CAN bus and or USB 3 are used for high reliability.
