# Aniprinter

Printer for my ani* set of hardware!

Anime printer!!! I'm gonna add some cat ears lol

## Goal

This is going to be an anime printer, so it'll print figurines (They are always too expensive for me)

There must be multi color support, and cat ears on the printer

## Plan

I don't fucking know but I'll figure it out in the vacations. I never failed anything when money isn't a constraint :P

- Bed slinger
- 300x300x350mm (Figurine size :D)
- Multicolor <- Most important
